Profile card component

Description:

A profile card component is a user interface element commonly used in web and mobile applications to display brief information about an individual or a user. It 

is designed to provide a compact and visually appealing summary of someone's profile, typically including their profile picture or avatar, name, job title or 

description and additional relevant details. 

The specific details and design of a profile card component can vary based on the application or platform where it is used.

It can be used in various web applications or websites to showcase user profiles or team member details.

The goal is to provide a quick overview of essential information while maintaining a visually appealing and intuitive design.

It often employs visual elements such as colors, typography, and icons to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly presentation.

I was motivated to design this profile card component as it helped me to improve on my CSS skills.

The technologies that I used to build this application are HTML and CSS.

The URL of the deployed application is

One of the challenges that I faced was getting the right font sizes. Fortunately, the font sizes were provided in the starter code.

I did some research on google for tips and ideas on getting the layout right. This helped me to resolve the areas that I had issues.

I am grateful to my mentors for the support that they provided to me during the creation and designing of this project.
