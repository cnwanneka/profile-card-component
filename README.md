Profile card component

Description

A profile card component is a user interface element commonly used in web and mobile applications to display brief information about an individual or a user. It is designed to provide a compact and visually appealing summary of someone's profile, typically including their profile picture or avatar, name, job title or description and additional relevant details. 

The specific details and design of a profile card component can vary based on the application or platform where it is used.

It can be used in various web applications or websites to showcase user profiles or team member details.

The goal is to provide a quick overview of essential information while maintaining a visually appealing and intuitive design.

It often employs visual elements such as colors, typography, and icons to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly presentation.

The technologies used for this application are HTML and CSS.

I was motivated to design this profile card component because it enabled me to keep my CSS skills sharp and up to date.

The URL of the deployed application is https://cnwanneka.github.io/profile-card-component/

One of the challenges that I faced was getting the right font size but some of the text sizes were provided in the readme file.
