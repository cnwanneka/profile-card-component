Profile card component

Description

A profile card component is a user interface element commonly used in web and mobile applications to display brief information about an individual or a user. It is designed to provide a compact and visually appealing summary of someone's profile, typically including their profile picture or avatar, name, job title or description and additional relevant details. 

It can be used in various web applications or websites to showcase user profiles or team member details.

The technologies used are HTML and CSS.

Designing this profile card component was helpful in keeping my CSS skills up to date.
